#Vertical Rhythm Typography

This is an illustration of concepts described in [The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web, Rhythm & Proportion](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2). Note how all lines of text are aligned to the underlying grid. 

This work was based on https://drewish.com/tools/vertical-rhythm/, however it is more strict, as all the font baselines are placed on the grid.

The sample is optimized for [Source Sans Pro font](https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro), 16px tall, with 1.5 (24px) line height. Other fonts may require small padding tweaks.
